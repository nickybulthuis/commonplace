The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an
ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen
and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day.

– Morgan Housel
