The majority of investors should be satisfied with the reasonably good return obtainable from a defensive portfolio.
<!--more-->
Why? Because "[the majority of investors]" do not have the time, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark
upon such investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satisfied with the reasonably good return obtainable
from a defensive portfolio, and they should stoutly resist the recurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating
into other paths.
