The two basic sources of the superior returns achieved by the index fund: (1) the broadest possible diversification,
eliminating individual stock risk, style risk, and manager risk, with only market risk remaining; and (2) the tiniest
possible costs and minimal taxes. Together, they enable the index fund to provide the gross return earned in the stock
market, minus a scintilla of cost.
